About Me
I started programming somewhere around in 2019, mostly out of a desire to replicate what was at the time, the coolest technology on the market: AI Voice Assistants. I picked up some basic python, and got to work; writing long chains of if-statements to replicate the functionality I saw in Alexa and Google Home. My parents noticed this and encouraged me in it so that by the next year I started my first college class towards a Bachelors in Data Science.">

<p>I started programming somewhere around in 2019, mostly out of a desire to replicate what was at the time, the coolest technology on the market: AI Voice Assistants. I picked up some basic python, and got to work; writing long chains of if-statements to replicate the functionality I saw in Alexa and Google Home. My parents noticed this and encouraged me in it so that by the next year I started my first college class towards a Bachelors in Data Science.</p>
<p>I finished that degree this June, having now matured through my passion for code into a smart and well-rounded programmer. Now, I am looking for a job in the software development space where I can begin to specialize by providing value to a team of excellent programmers, learning under their leadership, and programming <em>like a madman</em> full-time.</p>
<h2 id="credentials">Credentials</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated TESU with a B.S. in Data Science (3.85 GPA)</li>
<li>Completed courses on SQL and Python from Boot.dev (level 40 Scholar)</li>

Some wrong assumptions to make about the later items would be that I find them inherently confusing or that I rarely use them. For example, I know much more Java than Bash, but Bash is both less complex and more commonly used than Java, because of it&rsquo;s place as a scripting language.<br></h5>

<h3 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h3>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>One of my greatest skills is the ability to learn deeply at a fast pace. When I encounter a new API, for example, one of the first things I naturally do is wonder how it&rsquo;s implemented under the hood. I enjoy the oportunity to, whenever I can, build tools from scratch rather than just importing them. Not that I always so far as to re-write the whole tool, but the confidence to know it can be done, and the experience to guess how is a great foundation for learning and writing good code with that tool.</p>
<h4 id="presenting">Presenting</h4>
<p>I learned public speaking in High-school, where I took classes from a local pastor and competed in the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association (NCFCA). I competed in the NCFCA in Speech for ~2-3 years and Lincoln-Douglas debate for 1 year.</p>
<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<h3 id="co-op-database">Co-op Database</h3>
<p>The Co-op database is a project I started working on with the goal of replacing the nightmare of an Excel sheet my local co-op was using to keep track of students, families, classes, teachers, registrations, payments, and more.</p>
<p>This project was also my first introduction to web development, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot over the it&rsquo;s many re-writes. My most recent version (shown below), includes a hand-rolled authentication and primitive authorization system. I used constant-time hash-checking, and were proper hashing and salting. I also implemented protections against CSRF (form-implemented), XSS, SQL-injection, and brute-force attacks. You only see the Classes table here, but I also designed a database schema for the other parts.</p>

<h3 id="tic-tac-toe-ai">Tic-tac-toe AI</h3>
<p>This is a fun project I like to build to learn the basic syntax of a new language. It&rsquo;s a simple search algorithm (minimax) that can be used to play simple games.</p>
<p>I also have a similar project which plays mancala with a more advanced version this algorithm. That one is written in Rust and also has the added difficulty of being a multithreaded incomplete search, requiring depth-limiting game tree calculations.</p>

    </div>

<h3 id="posix-http-server-wip">POSIX HTTP Server (WIP)</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to build a basic multithreaded HTTP server in C using just POSIX (techncially glibc) functionality. To non-technical people this will sound no different from any other website, but developers know that the self-inflicted handicap of using only POSIX C is a huge deal. It requires re-implementation some key functionality (the HTTP protocol) that developers use to facilitate web communcation in their code.</p>
<p>After this project is working (at least with basic MIME types), I plan on building a simple and lightweight key-value store in C, which can then be used in combination with the server to create a full-stack app in Pure POSIX C/C++ (and DataStar/JS).</p>
<h3 id="basic-ssh-dns-esque">Basic SSH DNS-esque</h3>
<p>This one is a developer tool for people who have many computers they want to SSH into, but don&rsquo;t want to have to deal with changing IP addresses and keeping a proper DNS. It is a simple two-part system (client and server) which uses an S3 bucket as a SSOT to keep track of changing ip addresses between servers and clients.</p>
