<h2 id="why-i-work">Why I work</h2>
<p>My name is Andre Fontenele, and I am looking to build my career in software engineering/data science. I have always loved programming since I started writing Python at 14. This was the time when Home Assistants were just taking off, and the little boy in me thought they were just <em>so cool</em>. That Christmas my parents got me <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1098125975">this</a> book (would highly reccomend) for Christmas, and the following June I started taking classes for my B.S. in Data Science.</p>
<p>I finished that degree this June, having now matured into a all-around mid programmer. I am looking for a job now at which I can provide value to a team, learn under their leadership, and become the best developer I can by <em>programming like a madman</em>.</p>
