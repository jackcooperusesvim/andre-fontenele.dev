Backend Web-Dev,
Software Engineering,
Data Analytics,
Data Science

## About Me

I started programming in 2019, mostly out of a desire to replicate what was at the time, the coolest technology on the market: AI Voice Assistants. So 14 year old me picked up some basic python, and got to work; writing long chains of if-statements to replicate the functionality I saw in Alexa and Google Home. My parents noticed this and encouraged me in it so that by the next year I started my first college class towards a Bachelors in Data Science.

I finished my degree this June, having matured through my passion for code into a smart and well-rounded programmer. Now, I am looking for a job in the software development space where I can begin to specialize by providing value to a team of excellent programmers, learning under their leadership, and programming like a madman full-time.

### Soft Skills
#### Learning
One of my greatest skills is the ability to learn deeply at a fast pace. When I encounter a new API, for example, one of the first things I naturally do is wonder how it's implemented under the hood. I enjoy the opportunity to, whenever I can, build tools from scratch rather than just importing them. I don't always do these re-implementations, but having experience doing these re-implementations keeps me aware, whenever I am using a new library or tool, of how it is most likely to work, which saves significant time when learning new things.

#### Presenting
I learned public speaking in High-school, where I took classes from a local pastor and competed in the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association (NCFCA). I competed in the NCFCA in Speech for ~2-3 years and Lincoln-Douglas debate for 1 year.
